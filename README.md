### About ME
* Like learning and coding (Java, Kotlin, Python, C/C++, [System]Verilog, Scala, Rust) in my free time.<br>
* Love to make small objects in life.<br>
* Learning Java and Blender now.<br>
* Have a yellow plush parrot doll named 'Abeibei', who dons a hat that I personally knitted for him, and the name was bestowed upon him by my friend Lora.(My avatar)


### About ENV
* I mainly use Windows with devdisk(ReFS) to develop.
* I use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) to manage all of my toolchains(except [Python](https://www.python.org/)) on Windows.
* I use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) or [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) to write codes which run on STM32, ESP32 and etc..
* I use [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx) to start my projects and develop with HAL or LL library.
* I use [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com.cn/zh-hans/products/sdks/esp-idf) framework to develop ESP32 series.
* I mostly use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) but also use [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to configure my project.
