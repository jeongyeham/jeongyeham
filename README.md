### About ENV
* I mainly use Windows with devdisk(ReFS) to develop.
* I use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) to manage all of my toolchains(except [Python](https://www.python.org/)) on Windows.
* I use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) or [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) to write codes which run on STM32, ESP32 and etc..
* I use [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx) to start my projects and develop with HAL or LL library.
* I use [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com.cn/zh-hans/products/sdks/esp-idf) framework to develop ESP32 series.
* I mostly use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) but also use [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to configure my project.
